2003.0,mixtape,Get Well Soon...,2,Live From Irving Plaza NY,"Intro: Talib Kweli:
ALRIGHT
In case y'all don't know, he did H to the Izzo, he did Takeover, he did Guess Who's Back, he did my joint, Good to You, he did [?], give it up for my nigga Kanye West, you know what I'm saying?
Now Kanye, y'all also don't know my man got skills, he's a rapper, he's [?] projects, so can my man bust a verse?
What's up Kanye what's up?
Verse 1: Kanye West
Woooooo
Mic check, mic checkGolly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean two platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all
Hook:  Kanye West / Talib Kweli
Talib Kweli:
New York City here! New York City here!
Kanye West:
Its like, guess who's bizzack, back on the track with the blow
Kanye to-the, representing his gold
I guess who's come back, better than I suppose
Heard those beats, shit it's all I know
Guess who's bizzack, [?]
The Roc' is definitely in the building
Back on the track, yeah, yeah, yeah
Verse 2: Talib Kweli
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!
Damn, New York City in the house!
Talib Kweli gotta tell you what it's about
Because my man Kanye from the Chi' will say hi
Wave your hands from side to side
Mos Def, Kweli, [?]
[?]
I got my man, he represent the [?] projects
[?]
Verse 3: Mos Def
I say guess who's bizzack, Kweli, Kanye, and Mos
Punk niggas getting way too close
[?] Broadway doing them all day
Niggas [?] but don't take it the wrong way
[?]
Doing Iving Plaza, causing disaster
You bring the time but we bring the prescription
Pick up your ears so you all could listen

We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves
[Hook](Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil tryna break me down

Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?We ain't going nowhere but got suits and casesA trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope
[Hook]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cause we ain't spoke in so long
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down(Jesus walk with me)

Or here to convert atheists into believersI'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need JesusSo here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

2003.0,mixtape,Get Well Soon...,5,Through The Wire (Still Standing),"[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they?
Can they, Hop?
[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
(I spit it through the wire, man)
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
(There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man)
Through the fire (I'd gladly risk it all right now)
Through whatever, come what may (It's a life-or-death situation, man)
For a chance at loving you (Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man)
I'd take it all the way
(It's your boy Kanye to the... Chi-town, what's goin' on?)
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire
[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man
[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man)
For a chance to be with you (They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno)
I'd gladly risk it all (The doctor said like six weeks, y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw)
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
(I looked in the mirror)
For a chance at loving you
(And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it)
I'd take it all the way (But I'm still here for y'all right now, man)
Right down to the wire (This what I got to say right here, dawg)
Even through the fire (Yeah, turn me up, yeah)
[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)
I'd gladly risk it all (""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"")
Through the fire (""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"")
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man)
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire
[Outro: Elton John]
I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah"

I ain't gotta jack shitYou heard ""Takeover"", who running this rap shit?Ugh
Fake tits
Shut up and make hitsCan't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre?

WhoooooooaaNever leave me alooooooooone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home
[Verse: Kanye West]My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up thenI met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!""But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now I'm talkin about Chi-town

Bone girls on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man, no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen manLast 9/11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gasGotta lotta problems, money's one that I not have no moreUh, well Dame look at how everybody changedTell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the gameTell B.I.G. that we about to get paidAll my niggas about to have it made
This makes everything else sound playedGoddamn Kanye! (Kanye, Kanye)
Now hold upAin't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)I told dude ""You can't even rap on my interlude""
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'Yamamoto Adidas is sick with the fashion
Y'all already got dough so just spit for the passionThe way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacksAnd let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope, nope, let's not do that manYou eatin' up the game like Pac-ManHe got the whole world shakin' just like crack fiends

Let's take it there, take it there man
It's not supposed to be ???

(GLC where you at homie?)
How many niggas you know that put their life on the line to get signed?
Did a few high crimes, almost had lights out
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I might doubt, just look at my accountI used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressin'
When I copped them pounds it was my best investments
Dre got shot and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Last like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is clashin'
You ain't got no muscles you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut
Mm hmm, mm hmm, NAW, your hair sucks
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah
And offers to sell and yell, uh

Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo
[Hook]Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smokeOne look and murder she wroteShe drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..
[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaborationChi-Town and St. LouisShe said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'
[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like ""Nah, I wasn't sleep""Convenient whore stay on top of convenient storesKeep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in storeSee I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true storyI created 'hood rats so these new mice bore meSee I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hellI hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kanye West]What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life booCuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like youI talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a censusBut you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures
Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?Jimmy Choo, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensiveI know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me
That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo
She said ""He gay anyway, you don't know nothin' about Jamario""

2003.0,mixtape,I'm Good,11,Poppin' Tags (Remix),"[Hook: Kanye West]And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caughtAnd we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of courtCause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought
[Verse One: Ludacris]
Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, ""leave me alone!""
[Hook]
[Verse Two: Twista]
Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk
If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk
(Look out) Put a little bit of hash and some motherfucking purple haze
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci
Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for the city, anybody that different with me
Got into thinking its a game
And whether you in my city and I talk shit
I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name
I've been known to handle my business
Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla
Murder haters that I'm full of
Niggas claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003

You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(you got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(what else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (know what?) and drink some champagne with meAnd let me rap to you
[Verse 1: Kanye West]You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look IndianAnd ain't never seen him and MCMNow I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil'
Kim (yes I would)
We gon' roll this weedWe gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' these beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lotta clothes, I like to see her out of 'emShe got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chanceCuz I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighsLook, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and ""Do she need that beat tracked again?""
[Hook: Kanye West]
Cuz I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'See I came back for you
Cuz any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price
[Verse 2: Kanye West]Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believeBack when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZThe way she looked on Chyna Doll, I woulda did them beats for freeCause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D-Dot was t-teasin' meI bought some earrings like Baby that may be fake
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'Now maybe Kay can get a ménage with Lazy K
And Lady May, maybe hey
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her

[Outro: Kanye]
Got a two for head saleSend, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh Trina?
Oh I'm be right there, I'm right thereI'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes

Well, I'm in the club for a limited time only
Two way or phone me, if you tryna bone me

Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You a light skinneded Nia, dark skinneded Tamia
Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita

We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia

It be going in and out like a robberia
I'm tryna take this money like Rob and G-Dep
And I'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina

But not no lettuce for em
Dick and bad credit for em
Bills, bills, I know she tryna get paid
She know I'm tryna get laid
She figure that's an even trade offIf she a stewardess I show her to my cockpit
If she a lawyer then I give her Johnnie CochranIf she wanna see me again
She better get 2 friends then maybe then
We'll have group sex, toothexAnd a young girl off that XAnd she just turned eight-teen
Last week she was against the law
So for her birthday I put this dick against her jaw
And like a picture in a frame put it against the wall
Said she had never been with a man before
But she not a virgin, huh, she a lady lover
I didn't know y'all take each other out and date each other

A miseducation of Lauren that stayed in the hood
See she probably could have made it in Hollywood
But she was misguided, misled, and misunderstood
She wanted her baby dad with good hair like Blair Underwood
And push a whip with 12 cylinders under the hood

So she named one hope named the other ambition

I'd take it all the way (It's your boy Kanye to the... Chi-town, what's goin' on?)
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire
[Verse 1]I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessertSomebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerkHow do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?And just imagine how my girl feelOn the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett TillShe was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mineShe a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty signNo use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signedTryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelinesIn the same hospital where Biggie Smalls diedThe doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, manStory on MTV and I ain't trying to make a bandI swear this right here, history in the making, man
[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man)
For a chance to be with you (They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno)
I'd gladly risk it all (The doctor said like six weeks, y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw)
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may (I looked in the mirror)
For a chance at loving you  (And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it)
I'd take it all the way (But I'm still here for y'all right now, man)
Right down to the wire (This what I got to say right here, dawg)
Even through the fire (Yeah, turn me up, yeah)[Verse 2]What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the gameGood dude, bad night, right place, wrong timeIn the blink of a eye, his whole life changedIf you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe beltI swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla SkyIt was televisedThere's been an accident like GEICOThey thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did MichaelI must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his assUnbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas PastToys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cashAnd I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I didBut I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumphMake music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Hook/Outro]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)
I'd gladly risk it all (""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"")
Through the fire (""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"")
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man)
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fireTo the limit
Through the fire
To the limit
Through the fire
To the limit
Through the fire
To the limit"

2004.0,album,The College Dropout,2,We Don't Care,"[Produced by Kanye West]
[Intro]Oh yeah, I've got the perfect song for the kids to singAnd all my people that's...
[Hook]Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still aliveThrow your hands up in the sky and say:
""We don't care what people say""
[Verse 1]If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, manWe never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own manBut as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man
Man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people sayThis is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they ain't finna say: ""next summer I'm finna""Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarshipCause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown
[Hook]Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still aliveThrow your hands up in the sky and say:
""We don't care what people say""
[Verse 2]The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustleCause a nigga can't shine off $6.55And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob'sAnd bootlegged tapes just to get they cake upWe put shit on layaway, then come backWe claim other people kids on our income taxWe take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people sayMomma say she wanna move South
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work
He figured he'd take workThe drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weightA nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straightBut we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake
And ""we don't care what people say""
[Hook]Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still aliveThrow your hands up in the sky and say:
""We don't care what people say""
[Verse 3]You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park"", see, now we smartWe ain't retards, the way teachers thoughtHold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow classSad enough we on welfareThey tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchairI'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live hereLook what was handed us, fathers abandoned usWhen we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulanceSometimes I feel no one in this world understands usBut ""we don't care what people say""
My niggas
[Hook]Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25

""We don't care what people say"""
2004.0,album,The College Dropout,3,Graduation Day,"What in the fuck was that Kanye?!
I told you to do some shit for the kids!
You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now!
You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis!
You will not walk across that stage, you won’t slide across that stage!

Who told you see, I told you to do somethin' uplifting!
I’m tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you're gonna do me!You know what, you's a nigga!
And I don’t mean that in no nice way
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you
You throw your mutha hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody
Cause you gettin' the fuck out of this campus
What the fuck you gone do now[John Legend]I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybodyI'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybodyI got something better than school but don't tell anybodyMy momma would kill me but don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes I'm just not everybody"
2004.0,album,The College Dropout,4,All Falls Down,"[Hook: Syleena Johnson + Kanye West]Oh, when it all, it all falls downYeah, this the real one, babyI'm tellin' you all, it all falls downUh, Chi-Town, stand up!Oh, when it all, it all falls downSouthside, Southside
We gon' set this party off rightI'm tellin' you all, it all falls downWestside, Westside
We gon' set this party off rightOh, when it all
[Verse 1: Kanye West]Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in collegeThat major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funnyNow, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair.""
‘Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
‘Cause her baby daddy don't really careShe's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter AlexisShe had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like EveAnd she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well[Hook: Syleena Johnson + Kanye West]Oh, when it all, it all falls downAnd when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downC'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all
[Verse 2: Kanye West]Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazyI can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this.""And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a teamIt seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteemThe prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond ringsWe shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade usWe tryna buy back our 40 acresAnd for that paper, look how low we'll stoopEven if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe[Hook: Syleena Johnson + Kanye West]Oh, when it all, it all falls downCome on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downAnd when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls downCome on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downAnd when it all falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'emWe buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedomWe'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of thatBut I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause, fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it[Hook: Syleena Johnson + Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls downC'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downC'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls downSouthside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downWestside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls downChi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downNow, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life

2004.0,album,The College Dropout,6,Spaceship,"[Produced by Kanye West][Hook]I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shitI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the skyI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shitI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky[Verse 1: Kanye West]If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then I'm gonna shorten the register upLet's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caughtThey take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakisBut let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the storeSo I'm on break next to the ""No Smokin'"" sign with a blunt in the mallTakin' my hits, writing my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mindThis fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcomeY'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dudeLock yourself in a room doing 5 beats a day for 3 summersThat's a Different World like Cree Summer'sI deserve to do these numbers""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""So many records in my basementI'm just waiting on my spaceship[Hook]I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shitI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the skyI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shitI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky[Verse 2: GLC]And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grindChi state of mindLost my momma, lost my mind
Life my love, that's not mine""Why you ain't signed?""
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mineOnly one to ball
Never one to fallGot to get mine
Got to take mineGot a Tec-9Reach my prime
Got to make these haters respect mineIn the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelvesWaiting patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweetYes I'm the same ol' G, same goateeStaying low key, nopeHoller at God ""Man why'd you have to take my folks?""Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef GLove my G, Rolly GPolice watch me smoke my weed, count my G'sGot a lot of people counting on me
And I'm just trying to find my peaceShould've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece (blaw!)[Hook]I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shitI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the skyI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shitI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky[Verse 3: Consequence]I remember having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Trying to make this thing rightAnd having one of my co-workers say ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goesNo more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me
A&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from meSo naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at meCause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back thereSo I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off[Hook]I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shitI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the skyI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shitI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me, brother, for a ride"

Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?We ain't going nowhere but got suits and casesA trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis

Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be differentNow niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership

So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought herYou sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled upBut I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye

We are all here for a reason on a particular pathYou don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn seriousThat's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girlsI'm not just another individualMy spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritualBut I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyricalI'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mentalThat's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent dayBut that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta KinteI'm trying to get us ""us free"" like CinqueI can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self downIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you downAnd when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhymeSo I guess I'm one of a kind in a full houseCause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out (Take'em to the church)

And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs outWell okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charmAyo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?And sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behaviorAlways got something to say like a okay playa haterAnyway, I don't usually fuck with the InternetOr chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or trying to get off cigarettes?If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yetNow I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderateI got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it
[Verse 4: Common]Get 'em high like noon or the moonOr a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dopeY'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotesReal rappers is hard to find, like a remoteControl rap is out ofUsed to, but still got loveThat's why I abuse you who are not thugsRock clubs, it's like Tiger
Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show, called Soul SurvivorI stole on liver, niggas than youYou's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than youHow could I ever let your words affect meThey say Hip-Hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect meMarsha's too sexy to even make songs like theseThat's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia KeysToo many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popularTwelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come, you the hot garbage ofThe year's clear your image and snooped upLabel got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nutVideo hard to watch like MedusaEven your club record need a boosterChimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate niggaRead the infra-red across your head, I'm bred king like SimbaBolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper
Just an emcee with a temperYou dancing for money like Honey, I did this my waySo when the industry crash, I survive like KanyeSpittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then
[Hook: Kanye West]N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em highNow I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em highAnd if you're losin' your high then smoke again
Keep 'em high"

[Intro]Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they?
Can they, Hop?
[Hook]Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I spit it through the wire, man)
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all (There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man)
Through the fire (I'd gladly risk it all right now)
Through whatever, come what may (It's a life-or-death situation, man)
For a chance at loving you (Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man)
I'd take it all the way (It's your boy Kanye to the... Chi-town, what's goin' on?)
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire
[Verse 1]I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessertSomebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerkHow do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?And just imagine how my girl feelOn the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett TillShe was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mineShe a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty signNo use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signedTryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelinesIn the same hospital where Biggie Smalls diedThe doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, manStory on MTV and I ain't trying to make a bandI swear this right here, history in the making, man

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man)
For a chance to be with you (They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno)
I'd gladly risk it all (The doctor said like six weeks, y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw)
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may (I looked in the mirror)
For a chance at loving you  (And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it)
I'd take it all the way (But I'm still here for y'all right now, man)
Right down to the wire (This what I got to say right here, dawg)
Even through the fire (Yeah, turn me up, yeah)[Verse 2]What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the gameGood dude, bad night, right place, wrong timeIn the blink of a eye, his whole life changedIf you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe beltI swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla SkyIt was televisedThere's been an accident like GEICOThey thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did MichaelI must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his assUnbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas PastToys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cashAnd I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I didBut I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumphMake music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Hook/Outro]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)
I'd gladly risk it all (""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"")
Through the fire (""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"")
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man)
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fireTo the limit
Through the fire
To the limit
Through the fire
To the limit
Through the fire
To the limit"

And have a reason to cover my faceI even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do itWhen I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?As kids we used to laughWho knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
[Hook]And I don't care 'bout
(all the diamond rings all the diamond rings)

I tell you that all is my weight and gold
(all that glitters is not gold, now gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things
(real is what you lease on me)
[Verse 2]This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with usCome on, let's take a family Grammy pictureAbi, remember when they ain't believe in me?

But every holiday nobody eating her foodAnd you don't wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousinsAct like you ain't took a bath with your cousinsFit 3 in the bed if it's 6 of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
[Interlude]Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
[Verse 3]I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and gunsKeep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sunAll my niggas from the Chi, that's my family, dogAnd my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dogI feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dogYou ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'Sittin' here, grillin' people like George ForemanWhy Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storm out then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunionAnd drink some wine like CommunionAnd act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business

And come back next year with the whole fucking gameAin't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flopThen maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself

They say he bougie, he big-headed

Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhymeNow I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreamsI use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassedBut without it I'd be last, so I ought to laughSo I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no moreYou niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more

So get your ass up off the wall""... last call for alcohol, for my niggas""[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin withSo won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""
No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""[Saxophone Solo]I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back thenI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time.And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Explosive"" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't be Life.""And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""[Jay-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]
And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it, one take. And he said
[Jay-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]
""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""
[Jay-Z: ""so what you think of this?""]
And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...
[Mother: ""Come on, let's just go""]
...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...
[Mother: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]
...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat
To DMX
[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""
[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]
""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics""
[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]
You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said ""man that was tight.""
[Jay-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]
That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say ""naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...
[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]
I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up
[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]
Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad
[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""
[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'"

In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him

[Hook: Kanye West]Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 1: Kanye West]My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the dayDown the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me aloneBulls jacket with his hat broke way offAnd walked around the mall with his radio face offPlus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the manBack when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of CapricesDrove by the teachers, even more by policesHow'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin'Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavyHit Lake Shore, girls go all crazyHit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a carYou was the Chi-Town version of BabyAnd I was just a virgin, a babyOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazyI used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got crankedWe'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie
[Hook: Kanye West]Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 2: Paul Wall]What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk wavingThe candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazingThem elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'LacTrunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet parkOpen up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the darkYou see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slabBut I could still catch boppers if I drove a cabA young Houston hardhitter all about the scrillaRidin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that ScrewI'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie
[Hook: Kanye West]Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Interlude: GLC]Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoesIf you're riding around the city with nowhere to goLive today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I liveAnd that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something seriousI got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rimsI got the baller genetics, baby, this evidenceYou see a player flicking, and how you ain't convincedThat you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chainMy canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a kingWith that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali greenMy woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on VoguesMy cylinder quiet, like tip-toesI sold O's, and this I knowWhen you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow[Hook]
Drive slow, homie

[Verse: Common]
YeahThey say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate isI stroll where souls get lost like VegasSeen through the eyes of rebel glassesPray to God that my arms reach the massesThe young smoke grass in grassless junglesRubber band together in cashless bundlesWe wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remainsMakin sense of it we hustle for changeRevolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightinSomeone to stay in they corner like Mike TysonHypes fightin for hits to heighten they hellDon't he know he could only get as high as he fell?Show money becomes bail, relationships become jailChildren are unheldI wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale - Horse""Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it -
[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]""Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home againI'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm goneHome is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and itMight not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again"""

He claim her heart can't take the anaesthesiaIt'll send her body into a seizureThat lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepinHey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'I'm arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right hereMy grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong

Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kidsBut they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my driveCause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me aliveJust the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mindAnd get some leeway on the he say she sayYour girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?Spanish girls say ""Yo, no hablo inglés""And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myselfDawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myselfMade a mil' myself and I'm still myselfAnd I'mma look in the mirror if I need some helpNow I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

2005.0,album,Late Registration,13,Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix),"[Produced by Kanye West, Devo Springsteen and Jon Brion]
[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me
[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample](Diamonds are forever forever forever)Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever foreverThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)[Verse 1: Kanye West]Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for realLittle was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we ownWhen I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my homeMy chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, manSee, a part of me saying ""Keep shining""
How when I know what a blood diamond is?Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmsesI thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armlessAnd here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
Bought a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like IkeYou can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight
[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample]
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)[Verse 2: Kanye West]People asking me, ""Is I'm gon' give my chain back?""
That'll be the same day I give the game backYou know the next question, dog, ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""[Verse 3: Jay-Z]Yup, I got it from here, 'Ye, damnThe chain remains, the gang is intactThe name is mine, I'll take blame for thatThe pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at thatHow could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to meDifficult takes a day, impossible takes a weekI do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CD'sI'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man!Let me handle my business, damnKanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch meBleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymesThe Dynasty like my money; last three lifetimesShirley Bassey's in the rear saying exactly
What I've been saying practically my whole careerThe diamond is forever, I've been minin' this foreverNow the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be betterPeople lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash, like a phoenixIf you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time(I'm Young, bitches!) Good night!"

And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't affordSee you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot

Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
[Verse 2]Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry

Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the FedsSo I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinksBut looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, cause I'da gone in by tenBut I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind barsAnd since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes

Kanye step away from the lime

Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova

Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me
[Hook]Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibeDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)The Roc is still alive every time I rhymeForever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[Verse 1]Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magicVegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glassesAnd I've realized that I've arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my VibeDoes he write his own rhymes, well sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought ofDamn, is he really that caught up?I ask if you talked about classics, do my name get brought up?I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's importantIf your stripper name ""Porscha"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""Excuse me, that's just the Henny, manI smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't because
[Hook][Verse 2]I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelryAlicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
30 minutes later sein' there's no convincin' himWhat more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years oldYou gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soulAnd wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fameWhen he came in the game, he made his own laneNow all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say KayneGot family in the D, Kin-folk from MotownBack in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe TownLife movin' too fast I need to slow downGirl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go downMy father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesarThe preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegicYou know who you call, you got a message, then leave itThe Roc stand tall and you would never believe itTake your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimicYeah, the beat cold but the flow is anemicAfter debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left offRight when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up""Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed upIn the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next upPeople askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game backYou know the next question dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

And when The Workout Plan ain't work out manMe and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner
[Verse 2: Common]
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
I open my eyesThe corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized
The black enterprize
The passion arise
The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalizeTryna' build a spot where ghetto bastards can riseThe ghetto has been bastardized by those who capitalizeWonder if its a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised
On the corner"

2007.0,album,Graduation,4,I Wonder,"[Produced by Kanye West]
[Hook]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
[Verse 1]
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at nightYou say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight
[Hook]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
[Verse 2]
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, wordDo you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue isYou can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yetAnd that's what intuition isWhen you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?
[Hook]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
[Verse 3]And I'm back on my grindA psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skylineAnd that's why I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?I'm a star, how could I not shine?How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in your blouse got me feeling so arousedWhat you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kidsYou ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you’ll ever find your dreams?"

Stadium status
[Hook]My big brother was B.I.G.'s brotherUsed to be Dame and Biggs' brotherWho was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friendNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin[Verse 1]It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, selloutPicture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell outYou know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass byBack of my mind, ""He could change your lifeWith all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
[Hook]My big brother was B.I.G.'s brotherUsed to be Dame and Biggs' brotherWho was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friendNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin, Begin
Let the story beginIf you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
[Verse 2]Fresh off the plane, I'm off to BaselineNothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for himI'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowdBig brother got his show up at Madison SquareAnd I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two ticketsI guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distanceBut everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potentOnly thing I wanna know is why I get looked overI guess I'll understand when I get more olderBig brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
[Hook]
[Verse 3]Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, HovitoThe game gettin' foul so here's a free throwI was always on the other side of the peepholeThen I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steepleAnd we know, ""New Jack City"" got to keep my brotherBut to be number one I'mma beat my brotherOn that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my assSibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' meAt the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to beWhen I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-goI guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger rollBut I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all knowI told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""Translate, español: ""No way, Jose""Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
[Bridge]My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brotherIf you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'emPeople never get the flowers while they can still smell 'emA idol in my eyes, god of the gameHeart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chainNever be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother
[Hook]My big brother was B.I.G.'s brotherUsed to be Dame and Biggs' brotherWho was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends[Outro]

Man (man), I wouldn't let a moment passWhat do it mean when you dream that you fallin'What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'What do it mean when you never dream at all thenAnd you don't really know cause you can't recall themIt's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye toMaybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life (real life), if you try toSo close (so close), but so far (so far)
And so far (so far), no cigar (no cigar)We can't dwell on the past all we got is today
So I'mma live like it's no tomorrow
No goodbyes

2007.0,album,Graduation,15,Bittersweet Poetry,"[Hook: John Mayer + (Kanye West)]Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you, hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
(See what I want so much should never hurt this bad)(Never did this before, that's what the virgin says)(We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says)(God talk to me now, this is an emergency)
[Verse 1]And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgeryAnd I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposelyWe breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking thenHave you ever felt you ever want to kill her?And you mix them emotions with tequilaAnd you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fightAnd you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say ""Motherfucker your momma's a bitch.""You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of youBut I'mma be the bigger manBig pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure it's
[Hook]
[Verse 2]And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin' currentlyBut I been thinkin' and it got me back to sinkin'And this relationship it even got me back to drinkin'Now this Hennessy
It's gonna be the death of meAnd I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexuallyCause every time that I'd try you would question me
Saying, ""You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?You don't see how our life was supposed to be?And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them ho's will be.""
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me[Hook]
Bittersweet (I fucked up and I know it G)
You're gonna be the death of me (I guess it's bittersweet poetry)
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you, hate you at the very same time

Still rock the Prada 'fore that, rock the Starter

Side of the broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars

Come to the grip with conflict diamonds and the arts

I been to the Grammy's, he been to the AVN's, you know. I'm, and, actu- I'm envious of him, cause Rick Rubin, he actually asked me to go to the AVN's, and I was like, ""Man, I can't do it. I just made 'Jesus Walks'. They gon' see me, and they gon' take away my NAACP award."" So I was, uh, you know, I have to watch pornos in the privacy of my own home, you know? I really want to go AVN's, but, you know, I can't do it, cause they'll take me off the cover of Jet, and then what? Now I won't make it on the cover of Essence. But one day, one day I'll be there. I'ma have one on of them BAPE hoodies zipped-up with the eyes cut out and some, some gloves with the fingers cut off so I could feel, too, so I could touch. You know they let celebrities touch.

Yes, welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli
Ladies...
I got you in the mood, for an interlude
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview
I know you into me, so, let me get into you
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin and rappin and *fcukin*, And passin the dutch and Relaxin and puffin and hittin and duckin
The rippin production, these kittens ain't muffins
Just because we stuff 'em in the oven
My words drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady
But, one glimpse and I know they ready, you already know
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!
[Chorus] x 2
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
Kanye:
You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told y'all, oh
Lose, eat crews like crews like soulfood
The only producer that feel like ""fuck rappers!""
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker
So if he say nigga, then I'ma say *cracker*
Is this the Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like, just like..
I'm the shit (Uggh)
You ain't figured out what I'm about yet
Always rockin that 'this ain't out yet'
But this ain't 'bout that
From a city where niggers plug like outlets
Far as music go yo, it ain't no outlets, so
When I go out, niggers always out to get me in the studio
And I ain't in the mood to flow
I'm with my girl and I'm tryin to hit the movies yo
And they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tooty
This girl got a silicone booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like Fifty, throw her in a pool G...
[Chorus] x 2
Talib: Break it down
Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum
'Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun
Completely done with rap dudes - don't compete with the dumb
I spill my blood for the people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Dante and Main Flow
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bonjangles-ass dudes
Dancin around the club, doin the tango
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!

[Verse]
I've always been the same since back in the day
Always felt like we should get paid
To be on magazines or we get playedWhy did he say it? I don't know, ask Gabe
Now I'm on the magazines where the roses arePoppin' champagne and that Rosé Don
Won a few awards then we went on tourAnd yup in my bag a whole bag of porn
Magazines hate him, then they love him
Then they hate him (we hate him), fuck it what to say then?(fuck it)Cover of The Fader (yeah)
Now I'm on my way up
Now you want me say what? Huh, you want me say what?I be talking my shit so I guess I'm an asshole
They be kick and pushin' like Lu Fiasco
And I guess every time I'm just gon' get in that mode
Suck up to the press, I guess miss that voteI did an interview with The Rolling Stones
Read the interview, man the whole shit wrongFar as this shit go, you know the way I wanna glow
I need Al Gore to recount that vote
You know you know you know, you know
You think that you know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but I'm right here
You think you really know, but you have no idea
And I'm gon' be the same my whole career, yeah
I'm gon' stay the same my whole career, you know?"
2007.0,mixtape,Can't Tell Me Nothing,12,Interviews (Interlude),"This is my problem with interviews, you know. What if you did music and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio? And you don't even get a chance to listen to it before they dropped it to radio. That's how interviews are. You, you say what you say and then you'll get paraphrased and then they'll do shit like, if you say a joke, most jokes are inappropriate. They's, they're like fucked up things that you say but it's kind of funny the way you word 'em. And if you take away, you know, the setup or the punchline, you just sound absolutely crazy. Which is, they love to do that because I love to joke and I give them too much and then my shit don't be like all dry ass interviews and stuff, like I don't have media training or whatever. And then, so they take that, and I, and I told Gabe, I said look, well I wanna, I wanna do uh, I wanna get approval over the shit, just because I wanted to be as entertaining as possible, I want people to have the information. And you know, like a lot of magazines, they got real uptight, they like, ""no you 'on't get approval, you 'on't get approval, you don't get approval."" So, you know, when I say the line 'bout The Rolling Stone, I don't have a problem with Rolling Stone. I really appreciate the fact that they did put me on the magazine and I realize that you know I was halfway out of my mind for the past two years and shit. I was, you know, off that drug called fame and shit like that, I was really like, I was like a little crazy, you know what I'm sayin', like I've calmed down and shit and like come back to Earth. So, you know, for the editor of Rolling Stone, I wanted to say that. But I do wanna say that it was pieces of the article that was, information in the article that was incorrect. And you know, if you allowed me to proofread it, the people could've had the proper information. And just to speak to the De LaChapelle, 'cause De LaChapelle's one of my favorite photographers, modern day Warhol. I wanna speak to the cover. You know, people say, ""Okay well he has a god complex."" Fam if someone's in college and they do like a play where they emulate Christ, do they have a god complex? Are they allowed to do that? You know, it's because of my position, it's like I'm not allowed to be creative. So every cover I take has to just be a picture of my face and shit, just... look it's my face! It's me! And sometimes it's like after you see—after I see me so much, I get tired of me and shit... I gotta look at me every day! I wanna do shit that's exciting to me. So the Rolling Stone's cover was exciting to me, that shit went down in history. I did it purely for creative reasons, it was't speaking upon you know, anything disrespectful to Christianity, to anything like that. It was something I did purely creative. Lot of times I do shit and people take more out of it. You know like I said Bush doesn't care about Black people and then people took it and said, ""Well you said, ""Bush hates Black people."""" You know, everybody takes it and makes it what they want it to be. When you know, I just say, I express something. You know, the other day somebody came to me like, ""Okay well who you voting on? Barack or Hillary?"" And I'm like I'm not really political dawg, I'm not getting into like you know I'm taking sides and this type of thing. He's like, ""What do you mean you're not political? You're not..."" I was like, fam! I'm emotional! I'm social! I'm like... I'm an artist! Like if you give me the opportunity, I'm like the fan that got too close to the stage and shit. I'm the glitch in the matrix, I'm like the last person to say, yo I really feel... I know I'm supposed to feel like this and know I'm supposed to read this teleprompter or whatever, but I feel like this what I wanna say. That doesn't put me... I'm never going politically incorrect or anything. I don't know about politics like that. I just know about people. I make music for people"

I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me someKnow I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave
[Bridge: Ne-Yo]I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
[Hook: Ne-Yo]
[Outro: Ne-Yo]
Ain't no doubt, so strung out [x2]
Over you, over you, over you
Because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enoughShe's the sweetest drug, she's the sweetest drug"
2007.0,mixtape,Can't Tell Me Nothing,18,Throw Some D's (interlude),"(Intro)
This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?
(Chorus 1)
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different...
Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit
(Verse One)
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says ""is that He-Su's?""
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's...
(Chorus 2)
Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened
(Verse Two)
Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits?
Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'ma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say f**k getting them D's
I'ma just ride out with these"

It's so crazy, crazy-crazyI got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubtEverything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was aboutDo you think I sacrifice, real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
Do you think I sacrifice, a real life
For all the fame, and flashing lightsThere is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To get my heart, out of this hell
And my mind, out of this jailThere is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in timeThere is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real lifeReal life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life

Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep runningIt's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find somethingI turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothingWhat does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feelDo you really have the stamina?

I can't..The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin at home and this was all a big dreamAnd the fame will be get gotAnd the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin the American dream
Chasin everything we seen, up on the TV screenAnd when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death

You haven’t, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather 'round children, zip it, listen[Hook: Teyana Taylor]Can we get much higher? So high

""You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?""

Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a LewisBeyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemiesSorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins lowDon't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh

Just kids, no parentsThen the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaronAnd the hell, it wouldn't spare us

I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I’ve foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down[Verse 1: Kanye West]Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec BaldwinInter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than BrandonAnd at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s randomBut we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrativeThis the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did itI treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?[Hook: Kid Cudi]Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 2: Kanye West]Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missingThis is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attentionAs long as I’m in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meetBut this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my OlympicsWe make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dickAnd these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it![Hook: Kid Cudi]Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down[Verse 3: Kanye West]I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tightsShe told the director she tryna get in a school
He said “take them glasses off and get in the pool”It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad newsI was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don’t believe in yesterdayAnd what’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coachMy guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing cokeIt's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shitAct like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m coming after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, it's like that y'all
I don’t really give a fuck about it at allCause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls[Hook: Kid Cudi]Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down[Verse 4: Raekwon]I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kidArmani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and BenzesCounting up, smoking, one cuffLive as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck itSteam about a hundred and one L'sKites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was specialIt matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimalsThe older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunkThe black dutch, back of the old shedIf you can’t live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye[Outro: Kid Cudi]

I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus

[Verse 1]I’m living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do itScreams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme musicNo one man should have all that powerThe clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power(21st-Century schizoid man)The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain’t got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rollingWith some light-skinned girls and some Kelly RowlandsIn this white man world, we the ones chosenSo goodnight, cruel world, I’ll see you in the morning
Huh? I’ll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment
[Hook]No one man should have all that powerThe clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say(21st-Century schizoid man)[Verse 2]Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jokesYou short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies inAnd I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he’s so fucking giftedI just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vaultMy childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I’m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted meAs I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking
[Hook]No one man should have all that powerThe clock’s ticking, I just count the hoursStop tripping, I’m tripping off the powderTill then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say(21st-Century schizoid man)
[Verse 3]Colin Powells, Austin PowersLost in translation with a whole fucking nationThey say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation
Well that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversationAt the end of the day, god damn it I’m killing this shit
I know damn well y’all feeling this shit
I don’t need your pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you going home with?How Ye doing? I’m surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I’m drivingWhere the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting[Outro]Now this will be a beautiful death
(I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go)You got the power to let power go?(21st-Century schizoid man)"

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous[Verse 1: Kanye West]I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'allBaby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on callWe above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more coversHousekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videosThat know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voilaPraises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tadaAddress me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invitedNiggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work

I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in storeI'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawersDark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villainI went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroachesShow me where the boats is, Ferrari TestarossasAnd Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30

While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faithRange Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother GooseThem hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn'tI keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highnessI speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrilsParanoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jawFlaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls

The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsationI know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
[Verse 1: Kanye West]May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh she do itWhat happened to religion? Oh, she lose itShe putting on her make up, she casually allureText message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?I thought I was the asshole, I guess it’s rubbing offHood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhymeHard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I’m looking at her like this what you really wanted, huh?Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime[Hook 2: Kanye West]Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsationI know I’m preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
[Verse 2: Kanye West]When the sun go down it's the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyesWhy you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don’t leave while you're hot that’s how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for usI hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room wasThe Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme"", not ""Dior, homie""The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

All black tux, nigga shoes lavenderI never needed acceptance from all you outsidersHad cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lord's ladderWe still speeding, running signs like they don't matterUh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4's at the ClearportWhen it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sportNew Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraudDifferent traps, I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapewormsSpinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burnsI shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice overGetting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice rollerI'm making love to the angel of death

And still be addicted to them hoodratsAnd I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
[Hook: Kanye West]And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong

Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it offHoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafersYou can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofasEvery bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face itYou should leave if you can't accept the basicsPlenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrixInvisibly set, the Rolex is facelessI'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
[Verse 3: Kanye West]Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave
[Hook: Kanye West]And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Turn the camera on, she a born starTurn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth acheMake her knees shake, make a priest faint
Make a nun cum, make her cremateMove downtown, cop a sweet space
Livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes, whatWe headed to hell for heaven’s sakes, huh
Well I’mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah![Hook]
Have you lost your mind?

[Kanye West]Whose fault?
[Intro: John Legend]Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort, and my first resortYou call me motherfucker for longAt the end of it you know we both were wrong
[Hook: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call her names, names, for sure
[Verse 1: Kanye West]On a bathroom wall I wrote""I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""And I went and found somebody elseFuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking selfTill about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myselfSomebody help...

Stick around, some real feelings might surfaceBeen a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking youWhat the hell was I supposed to do?I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mineAnd you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' youLying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed youNow you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you1AM and can't nobody get a hold of youI'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?Even though I knew, he never told the truthHe was just gon' say whatever that you told him toAt a certain point I had to stop asking questionsY'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlersI heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girlYou getting blackmailed for that white girlYou always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl""You'll probably find one of them ""I like art""-type girlsAll of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girlAnd I was satisfied being in love with the lieNow who to blame, you to blame, me to blameFor the pain and it poured every time when it rainedLet's play the blame game
[Hook: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure[Verse 3: Kanye West]""Things used to be, now they notAnything but us is who we areDisguising ourselves as secret loversWe've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the streetGone for eternity
We erased one anotherSo far from where we cameWith so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-EHatred and attitude tear us entirely"" - Chloe Mitchell

2010.0,album,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,13,Who Will Survive in America,"Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolutionPeople don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honeyThe youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one nightDigging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guysAmerica stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vaginaWe learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfumeAmerica was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother countryWhose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded, the bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin'
In the mother country's crotchWhat does Webster say about soul?""All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night""After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have youWHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?

2016.0,album,The Life of Pablo,6,Low Lights,"You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me. 
Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there, because he...
He's gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out  his hand and guide me through
Oh yes he will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, he will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day he will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.
No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I'm crying now
It feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh lord thank you
You are the joy of my life."

Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erectionSmoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I thinkThat pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean

Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bagNow you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuckShe said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwardsYou're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom isThe head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cerealLord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first placeThe opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee

Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first baseA backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubsGot pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a listStrippers get invited to where they only got hiredWhen I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get firedI was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choirAny rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretariesFor all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, reallyI remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just diedTextin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout himHad my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitchSome days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my VansIf I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the XansI know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again

And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it outGod damn, got a bald fade, I might slamPink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam

Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go outWe need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like RobocopShe brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleepGet money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, moneyAnd as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place[Hook: Kanye West]
Please, no more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)

2016.0,album,The Life of Pablo,20,Saint Pablo,"[Intro: Kanye West]Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit
[Verse 1: Kanye West]My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die brokeGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say noPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on TwitterMy friends' best advice was to stay lowI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payrollThe media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of controlI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they controlI know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmationThis generation's closest thing to EinsteinSo don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel likeTroll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressiveThank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditionsMost Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producersDon't stare at money too long, it's MedusaThe ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
[Hook: Sampha]And you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, father, father...)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hiThe night sky, yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah
[Verse 2: Kanye West]I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to comeA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drumsI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids hoBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiledBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crimeThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dimeMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout ""how my neck look?""Well... it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chainsThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hardReal family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false realityWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?I am one with the people
I am one with the people (real)I've been woken from enlightened man's dreamCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteemLet me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touchI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happenSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resortI know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' meWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to seeI would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stoveBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go brokeOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's WaldoShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at AldoModern day MJ with a off the wall flow
[Bridge: Sampha]My life, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent to you, bringFly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
[Hook: Sampha]Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hiOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, father, father...)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
[Verse 3: Sampha]Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you playUnderstand, understand
Understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above
[Hook: Sampha]Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, father, father...)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
